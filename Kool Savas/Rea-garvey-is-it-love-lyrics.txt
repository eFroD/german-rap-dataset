She said she doesn't wanna get a reputation
A sweet, sweet smile is not an open invitation
She wants respect for all the ladders she's climbed
She doesn't want to be classified
He's a shirt and tie who's afraid of commitment
A desk jockey who had a good standard of living
Likes, laugh, love but we'll pay the price
He cleans up well but he's all so nice

Time stands still for no one
So get up off your knees
Stand still for no one
And no one's greed

Is it love, is it love, or are you just fooling around?
It's enough, it's enough, you put your head in the ground
Look up, look up, your world is crumbling down around you
Oh, wake up
Is it love, is it love, or are you just fooling around?
It's enough, it's enough, you put your head in the ground
Look up, look up, your world is crumbling down around you
Oh, wake up

She's done well for herself, a chess-grade-a
She tried love once but it just got in the way
Got the high-held hands and the house on the hill
She swapped her social life for a sleeping pill
He's married now but he still goes wild
His wife's at home, expect the third child
He said, the perfect life is just a matter of time
He knows what he wants if he can make up his mind

Time stands still for no one
So get up off your knees
Stand still for no one
And no one's greed

Is it love, is it love, or are you just fooling around?
It's enough, it's enough, you put your head in the ground
Look up, look up, your world is crumbling down around you
Oh, wake up
Is it love, is it love, or are you just fooling around?
It's enough, it's enough, you put your head in the ground
Look up, look up, your world is crumbling down around you
Oh, wake up

Ah, keine Instagram-Romanze
Zurechtgerückt und orchestriert, im echten Leben
Kommt es vor, dass ich nicht immer dein Held bin, du
Hältst mir den Rücken frei und hier alles zusammen, bis ich wieder komm'
Egal, wie kompliziert, du sagst, es wird schon, dis ist unser Job
Ich halt' den Kopf raus, schieb' mir Filme, als hätt' ich nicht schon genug gechillt
Verkacke was und fuck dich ab und frag' dich, warum du nicht willst
Du sollst dich auf mich verlassen können, ich will da sein
Doch tu' als wüsst' ich nicht, dass du mich von heut auf morgen verlassen könntest
Ich hab' nie gelernt auch anzukommen, musst' immer weiter rennen
Fühl' mich gleich eingegrenzt von allem, ich verlang' von dir kein Verständnis
Geb' mein Bestes, ich will nix mehr hinterfragen
Denn die Zeit, sie läuft, und vielleicht willst du nicht mehr warten, keine Ahnung

Is it love, is it love, or are you just fooling around?
It's enough, it's enough, you put your head in the ground
Look up, look up, your world is crumbling down around you
Oh, wake up
Is it love, is it love, or are you just fooling around?
It's enough, it's enough, you put your head in the ground
Look up, look up, your world is crumbling down around you
Oh, wake up
